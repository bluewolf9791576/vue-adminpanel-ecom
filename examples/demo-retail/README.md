# Retail Admin

Mini Ecommerce Demo project which uses auto generated data from official [React Admin Demo](https://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo). Use [FakeRest](https://github.com/marmelab/FakeRest), a 100% browser REST server which takes fake JS data and compatible with Simple REST data provider.

This fake server is combined to [FetchMock](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock) which ensures transparent local binding through `fetch` API. Also a good way to allow full browser e2e testing.
