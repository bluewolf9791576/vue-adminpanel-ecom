# Configuration

## Config File

Without any configuration, the page is pretty minimal, and the user has no way to navigate around the site. To customize your site, let’s first create a `.vuepress` directory inside your docs directory. This is where all VuePress-specific files will be placed in. Your project structure is probably like this:

```
.
├─ docs
│  ├─ README.md
│  └─ .vuepress
│     └─ config.js
└─ package.json
```
