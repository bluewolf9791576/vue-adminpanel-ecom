# Internationalization

See [dedicated guide](https://vtec.okami101.io/guide/i18n).

All localoized resource specific labels should be added to your own i18n json locale (`src/locales/[locale].json` as default for vue-i18n), by following a specific structure. Example for `monsters` resource :

* For resource name : `resources.monsters.name`, should have both singular and plural format separated by a pipe.
* For each field label : `resources.monsters.fields.[my-field]`
* For each specific resource enum (choices) : `resources.monsters.enums.[my-enum]`, mostly used for radio and simple select fields and inputs as default choices if none has been set.

Sample :

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "users": {
      "name": "User | Users"
    },
    "monsters": {
      "name": "Monster | Monsters",
      "fields": {
        "name": "Name",
        "email": "Email"
      },
      "enums": {
        "category": {
          "history": "History",
          "novel": "Novel",
          "comics": "Comics"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Resource translation

If you enable, a new query string with locale will be added on each api calls, it's up to you to handle it on backend.
