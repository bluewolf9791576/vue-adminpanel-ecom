# Form

The create and edit pages will allow creation of new resource item or modification of existing method, by using respectively `create` and `update` data provider methods. In general this pages will share same form although it is not required. With Vtec Admin, development of form can be done with minimal code thanks to many available input components that have knowledge of current form context.

## Layouts

Both create and edit layouts share similar layout as [show page](show) with specific contextualized actions. There is nothing more to say about them as the `VaForm` will do the real work.

### VaCreateLayout

:::tip CLONE
Note that the create page support copy of values from other existing resource, i.e. cloning, as soon as a specific `source` query string with a valid existing id is present. This is automatically done via `VaCloneButton` present by default on `VaDataTable`. This is why a `item` prop is available on `Create` vue component that allows you to inject it into `VaForm`.

### VaEditLayout

## VaForm

|> docgen va-form

Here a quick sample usage within the `VaForm` inside a `VaEditLayout` component :

```vue
<template>
  <va-form :id="id" :item="item" :saving.sync="saving" v-model="model">
    <v-row justify="center">
      <v-col lg="6">
        <base-material-card>
          <template v-slot:heading>
            <div class="display-2">
              {{ title }}
            </div>
          </template>
          <v-card-text>
            <va-autocomplete-input
              source="book"
              reference="books"
              model="book_id"
            ></va-autocomplete-input>
            <va-radio-group-input source="status" row></va-radio-group-input>
            <va-rating-input source="rating"></va-rating-input>
            <va-text-input source="body" multiline></va-text-input>
            <va-text-input source="author"></va-text-input>
            <va-date-input source="publication_date"></va-date-input>
          </v-card-text>
          <va-save-button :saving="saving"></va-save-button>
        </base-material-card>
      </v-col>
    </v-row>
  </va-form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ["id", "title", "item"],
  data() {
    return {
      saving: false,
      model: {},
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

This form page will use special VA input components that are aware of current route context and are able to catch and edit the value of resource property indicated on the `source` prop.

Note that the main internal form model will be autogenerated from all inputs that will be present on this form. If you inject an existing item into `VaForm`, the main form model will takes his actual values that will be reflected for each input.
