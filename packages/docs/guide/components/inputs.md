# Inputs

VA input components allow editing of particular property of existing API resource object. Mainly used on [forms](../crud/form) for create and edit views. Can also be used as filter input for [`VaDataIterator`](../crud/list#data-iterator). For resource edition, it must be used within [`VaForm`](../crud/form#injector), which handle item injection and form model supply with error messages.
