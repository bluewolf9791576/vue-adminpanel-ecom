# Fields

VA field components allow custom and optimized display of specific resource property. It's mainly means to be used on [show](../crud/show) and [list](../crud/list) views. Use required `source` prop as resource property to fetch and display. Must be used with [`VaShow`](../crud/show#injector) component injector or with an explicit item object via `item` prop.
