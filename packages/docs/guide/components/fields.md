# Fields

VA field components allow custom and optimized display of specific resource property. It's mainly means to be used on [show](../crud/show) and [list](../crud/list) views. Use required `source` prop as resource property to fetch and display. Original API resource object is automatically fetched from store if `item` prop is not setted.
